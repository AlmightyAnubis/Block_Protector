# Block_Protector
This is a **client side** mod that prevents you from left clicking blocks you dont want to left click and prevents you from breaking them this way.

This is really helpful to not accidentally breaking budding amethyst, spawners or other blocks that will simply vanish after breaking. It only protects you from clicking on them directly, so if you use a other mod that breaks block without clicking on them, for example aoe tools, you could break this blocks. The only exception is the Automining mod which is compatible in the newest version. To add or remove blocks simply type

`/blockprotection add/remove blocklocation`

This mod is for forge. Other versions a currently not planed
